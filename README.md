This is a general module for the quantitative finance with deep reinforcement learning algorithm.

This is an article about optimizing quantitative trading strategies using machine learning and comparing them with traditional mathematical analysis methods. 
We propose a novel combined model of deep reinforcement learning and use artificial neural networks (ANN), Mulit-head attention mechanisms, and long short-term memory networks (LSTM), 
while deepening the network depth using residual networks. Extracting data in segments using moving window is used to improve data utilization and tighter context, ensuring that the model gets the latest environment in every interaction.
In order to cope with and satisfy different investment preferences, we set up joint loss function and make use of its nature to reasonably regulate risk and return, that is, to maximize profit under the condition of minimizing risk.
Under the new reinforcement learning algorithm FG, we finally achieved most of the annualized indicators, such as the annual return rate and multi-year cumulative return rate, higher than any previous Agent. 
The results show that our model has excellent robustness and revenue acceleration ability, which provides possible ideas for the future.
